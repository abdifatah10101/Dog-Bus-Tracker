#  Dog Bus Tracker

##  About  
A Python script that manages dogs riding on a bus. Each seat stores a dog’s name, breed, pickup, and dropoff time using nested dictionaries. I learned how to loop through data, add new pets, remove pets early, and print updated rosters using basic data-structure logic.

##  Features
-  **Seat-based system** using nested dictionaries  
-  Stores each dog's **name, breed, pickup & dropoff times**  
-  **Adds a new dog** if the bus has space  
-  **Removes a dog early** using `.pop()`  
-  **Prints starting & final rosters**  
-  Helps practice **Python data structures**

##  What I Learned
-  How nested dictionaries work  
-  Looping through keys and nested values  
-  Modifying data using `.update()` and `.pop()`  
-  Tracking data with simple logic  
-  Building readable output with loops

The program will:
1. Print the starting roster
2. Add a new pet (if seats are available)
3. Remove a pet early
4. Print the final roster with dropoff times
